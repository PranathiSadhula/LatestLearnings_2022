     * - scale
     *       --> Horizontal scaling :
     *       --> Vertical
     *   ex: Facebook users who create posts are relatively lesser than those who users read posts.
     *          so dealing create user and get user with different scales is recommended
     *
     * - Throttling :
     *      --> ex :
     *          -> in general ola app pings server saying that this so n so driver is available for ride,
     *          but if cab driver is opened his ola app but staying in a same place for longer than useual.\
