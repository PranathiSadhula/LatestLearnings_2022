     *
     * - Security -> how data injecting can be hndled, how headers are handled in end points, how http methods are hanle.
     *             -> authenticating and auherizing.
     *
     * - Throttling : if requests are bombared
     *
     * - Integration :  multiple micro services
     *
     * - Idempotency :
     *              how APIs behaving on hitting same rq for multiple times --> there should not be any difference.
     * - rate limiting :
     *          -> ex : linkedIn has limit of 50 connections per dat. so when you reach 51th cnnection , its gives rate limit.
